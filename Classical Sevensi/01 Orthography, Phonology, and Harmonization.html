            <section id="harmonization">
                <h3>Harmonization classes:</h3>
                <p>Any introductory examination of Classical Sevensi should begin with a look into its system of harmonization, known as <small>[translation forthcoming]</small>. Grammatically, harmonization refers to a morphological change in the vowels of a word in order to match the polarity of previous vowels. However, harmonization in Classical Sevensi is much more than a mere grammatical construct, having strong cultural and philosophical significance attached to it.</p>
                <p>Grammatically, Classical Sevensi features three polarities: positive, negative, and neutral. Which polarity a word belongs to is determined by the polarity of the vowels within the word. However, the philosophy of word harmony moves far beyond this narrow grammatical scope. Each consonant and vowel features its own blend of polarities, and it is the way in which these harmonies interact that is considered to give a word both meaning and power. The semantic connotations of word harmony are as follows:</p>
                <section id="pos">
                    <h4>Positive (+)</h4>
                    <p>Postive harmony is associated with the upward and backward directions, life, daytime, earth, strength, the physical, spring and summer, and masculinity.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="neu">
                    <h4>Neutral (0)</h4>
                    <p>Neutral harmony is associated with directionlessness, chaos, twilight, the air/atmosphere, permeance, the spiritual, the solstice, and neuter gender. In some instances, neutral harmony is considered to serve as a counterbalance or mediating force to strong positive and negative harmonies.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="neg">
                    <h4>Negative (&minus;)</h4>
                    <p>Negative harmony is associated with the downward and forward directions, death, nighttime, water, flexibility, the mental, autumn and winter, and femininity.</p>
                </section>
            </section>
            <section id="consonants">
                <h3>Consonant families:</h3>
                <p>Consonants in Classical Sevensi are grouped into families of voiced, devoiced, and aspirated forms. This is reflected in the orthography used to represent them: aspirated forms have an additional stroke over voiced forms, and devoiced forms consist of the voiced form doubled. In syllable codas, the aspirated glyph is generally used to represent devoiced forms, as it is easier to write and aspiration is never distinctive in the coda of a syllable.</p>
                <p>Consonant families are culturally strongly associated with harmonization classes. This comes, in part, from the prevalence of certain consonants in certian words, as well as associations between the location of the consonant in the mouth and frontness/backness. There is also a small collection of consonants without a formal family; these are likewise given polarities, but this association is often more flexible (with the exception of <span lang="art-x-osv">&#x1102;&#x1160;</span>, which has very strong associations with the negative).</p>
                <p>Voicing, devoicing, and aspiriation are themselves considered to have unique polarizations, with voiced consonants considered to be more positive, devoiced consonants considered neutral, and aspirated consonants considered to be more negative. It is the harmony between a consonant's major polarization (that of its family) and minor polarization (that of its form) that is considered to give a consonant its unique character.</p>
                <p>The consonants in Classical Sevensi are as follows:</p>

                <h3>Vowels:</h3>
                <p>Unlike consonants, where harmonization takes place mostly on a cultural level, the harmonization of vowels is a grammatical feature of the language. Non-neutral vowels in words are harmonized to match the polarity of previous vowels in the word, if present and non-neutral. You will never find a word in Classical Sevensi with a combination of both positive and negative vowels.</p>
                <p>Vowels in Classical Sevensi also take a variety of forms; these are plain, iotized, and W-form. They also come in one of several distinct qualities: rounded, unrounded, rounded-I, and unrounded-I. Note, however, that not all combinations of form and quality are possible; for example, it is generally impossible to have a rounded W-form vowel (with the exception of <span lang="art-x-osv">&#x1196;</span>).</p>
                <p>There are many orthographic hints as to the form of a vowel: Positive vowels have dots (ticks) above or to the right, negative vowels have dots below or to the left, and neutral vowels lack dots in general. Unrounded vowels are vertical, while rounded vowels are horizontal. *-I vowels are given an extra vertical stroke. Iotized vowels are given an extra dot. W-form vowels feature a combination of the rounded and unrounded forms.</p>
                <p>There are more positive and negative vowels than there are vowels which are neutral. This means that some neutral vowels are considered to do a sort of double-duty, being interpretable as one of two combinations of quality and form depending on context. There are also some combinations found in positive and negative vowels which do not appear in the neutral vowels. However, every positive vowel has a unique negative counterpart, and vice-versa.</p>
                <p>As with consonants, vowels in Classical Sevensi are considered to have a minor polarization which is associated with their form. Iotized vowels are generally considered to be more positive, while W-form vowels are generally considered to be more negative.</p>
                <p>The vowels in Classical Sevensi are as follows:</p>

                <h3>Syllables</h3>
                <p>Like most languages which use a hangul orthography, Classical Sevensi is written in syllable-blocks. Each syllable consists of three parts: an onset, which a consonant (required, but the letter <span lang="art-x-osv">&#x110B;&#x1160;</span> indicates no sound), a medial, which is a vowel, and an optional coda, another consonant. As stated above, devoiced consonants in the coda of a syllable are written using the aspirated form for convenience.</p>
                <p>For example, <span lang="art-x-osv">&#x1140;&#x1165;&#x1106;&#x1165;&#x11A8;&#x110A;&#x1175;</span> <small lang="art-fonipa-x-osv">/ɕʰevenɕi/</small> is written using three syllable-blocks, only one of which contains a coda. Note also how every vowel in the word is negative or neutral.</p>
