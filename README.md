#  SEVENSI  #

This is the official repository for Sevensi documentation and back-development.
That is to say, this repository takes Modern Sevensi and extant texts and documents and works backwards to construct past versions and cultures.
It also serves as a commentary for the Sevensi development process as-a-whole.

Development of the Sevensi language takes place as part of [The LANGDEV Project](https://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev/).
The LANGDEV Project repository should be consulted when researching the real-world development processes surrounding the evolution of Sevensi as a language; this repository provides the constructed fictional narrative.
These repositories work together in tandem, and both should be consulted whenever remarks or histories of the language are made.

Except where otherwise stated, all files published to this git repositiory are, to the extent possible under law, in the public domain. For more information, see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
