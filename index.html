            <p><i>Sevensi</i> is a fictional language created as part of <a href="https://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev">The LANGDEV Project</a>. It has been designed to be etymologically distinct from existing “real-world” languages for use in the construction of fictions and narratives. It has a unique culture, history, and linguistic tradition. It is open-source and in the public domain.</p>
            <p>It is also currently a work-in-progress.</p>
            <p>Efforts related to Sevensi development are currently focused on the completion of <i>Classical Sevensi</i>, which you can read more about <a href="classical">here</a>. This page will be updated with information as new developments are made.</p>
