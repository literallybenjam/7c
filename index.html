            <p><i>Sevensi</i> is a fictional language created as part of <a href="https://github.com/literallybenjam/langdev">The LANGDEV Project</a>. It has been designed to be etymologically and structurally distinct from existing “real-world” languages, with its own unique culture, history, and linguistic tradition. It is open-source and in the public domain.</p>
            <p>It is also currently a work-in-progress.</p>
            <p>Efforts related to Sevensi development are currently focused on the completion of <i>Classical Sevensi</i>, which you can read more about <a href="Classical%20Sevensi">here</a>. This page will be updated with articles and information as new developments take place.</p>
