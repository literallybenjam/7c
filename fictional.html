            <h2>A Fictional Language?</h2>
            <p>There are a variety of names assigned to languages which have developed over the course of a few years rather than centuries, by the dedicated efforts of a few individuals rather than the natural organic progression of an entire society. By far the most ubiquitous is the term <i>constructed language</i> (or <i>conlang</i>, for short), emphasizing the language's artifical nature. (<i>Artificial language</i>, <i>invented language</i>, and <i>planned language</i> are all very much in this vein.) But a <em>fictional</em> language? What, exactly, does that mean?</p>
            <p>Before getting steeped too deeply in definitions, it is important to note that not all constructed languages are fictional languages, even if all (or, at least, most—not trying to set too sharp of boundaries here) fictional languages are constructed. But I think the word <i>fictional</i> deliniates something special about the nature of the language, its development, and its situation in the world. Construction deals with structures; fiction is far more concerned with imagination and meaning.</p>
            <p>In an attempt to clarify the distinction that I see between a language like Sevensi and some others in the “conlang” field, I've put together a few points that I think help elaborate what exactly being a “fictional language” means.</p>
            <section id="01">
                <h3>01. A fictional language has a history.</h3>
                <p>And I don't mean a chronicle of how its developers pieced it together—although that, too, can be useful. I mean a history embedded <em>within the language</em>, a history that the language <em>tells itself</em>, a narrative by which the language is organized. This can take shape in a variety of forms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Structurally, this can show itself both through codified irregularities and common patterns. Connotations associated with certain constructions—having a certain word-order sound archaic, for example—create a sense of history and descendance, while normalized exceptions to the rule suggest that perhaps things weren't always the way they currently are.</li>
                    <li>Semantically, this can show itself on the level of etymology, idiom, and subtle word-connotation. Having words descended from a common root encodes an ancestry into their very form and pronunciation, while phrases which no longer make logical sense suggest a change in meaning over time.</li>
                    <li>Graphically, this can show itself through both similarities and irregularities in orthography. Similarities in character or letter-shape suggest a common historic source, while divergences between and unpredicticalities in orthography hint at phonologies or meanings (depending on the writing-system) now long past.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A language without a history is a language without a story, and fictional languages, first and foremost, are languages of stories.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="02">
                <h3>02. A fictional language is cultural.</h3>
                <p>While languages like Esperanto and Interlingua attempt to serve as a common tongue for people everywhere, a fictional language firmly situates itself within a certain time, place, and culture. As already stated, it is historical, and with that history comes a tradition of assigning certain meanings to certain ideas, of particular valuations and unique ways of viewing the world. Fictional languages do not concern themselves with concepts such as ease-of-learning or translatability—like the cultures they represent, they acknowledge and embrace that not all meaning is translatable. Nor do they attempt to structure themselves according to some sort of higher logic or practical intent; they are messy, the result of the convergence of thousands of ideas and concepts within one unifying structure.</p>
                <p>Fictional languages have codices and common cultural references. They have idioms drawn from ancient texts, and clichés born from cultural saturation and repetition. They have contradictions, and generally-accepted means of navigating them. They are stubborn in some ways, and radically open to change in others. They have their share of taboos, transgressions, and modes of conduct. They know when you're being polite.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="03">
                <h3>03. A fictional language belongs to no-one.</h3>
                <p>It doesn't make sense for <em>any</em> language to be bound up in copyright or patent laws, but this holds doubly true when your language is concerned with the telling and sharing of stories. Fictional languages are cultural, and like culture they need the freedom to morph and change on their own accord. They need a body of stories and cultural references that can be copied and re-appropriated freely, and the flexibility to insert themselves into new and exciting contexts. Fictional languages carry their cultures and histories inside them, so they do not need to limit themselves to any single time, place, demographic, or plane of existence. They maintain their adaptability not by detaching themselves from history or culture, but by leaving their histories and cultural meanings open to radical re-interpretation and application.</p>

                <h3>04. A fictional language is real.</h3>
                <p>The word <i>fictional</i> has implications of <i>make-believe</i>, and in a way, fictional languages are. But they are made of a belief in the power of imagination and storytelling, and through these, they manifest a new reality. Fictional languages are not solely academic objects of inquiry, and nor are they tools of pure utility. Fictional languages <em>mean something</em>, and that something is <em>real</em>. It matters, because they create a reality in which it matters. They are a history, they are a culture, and they cannot be denied. They offer a re-imagining of reality itself, and a unique avenue for true, meaningful change.</p>
